' //  The pulley joint is connected to two bodies and two fixed ground points.
' //  The pulley supports a ratio such that:
' //  length1 + ratio * length2 = constant
' //  Yes, the force transmitted is scaled by the ratio.
' //  The pulley also enforces a maximum length limit on both sides. This is
' //  useful to prevent one side of the pulley hitting the top.
